<!-- summary -->

A simple clock made to introduce myself into **React**, **PWA** and the deployment in **Github Pages**

## üí° Motivation

Almost 3 years back, I have made [this little clock](https://gonza7aav.github.io/colour-clock-app/original) in vanilla **JavaScript**. Once finished, I archived it in a folder... until now. I am starting in **React** and, why not recreating that colourful clock? At this moment, I wouldn't accept saving it again only on my pc, so I decided to host it with **Github Pages**.

Listening to some talks about **PWA**, I finally add the ability to install this web app on your device! After all, I just wanted to put this knowledge into practice

## üöß Prerequisites

- _[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)_
- _[Git](https://git-scm.com/)_ (optional)

## üõ†Ô∏è Install

1. Download this repository

   If you have _Git_, you can clone it with:

   ```console
   git clone https://github.com/gonza7aav/colour-clock-app.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies with:

   ```console
   yarn intall
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

In the project directory, you can:

- Run the app in the development mode:

  ```console
  yarn start
  ```

  Open `http://localhost:3000` to view it in the browser.

  The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

- Build the app for production to the `build` folder:

  ```console
  yarn build
  ```

  It correctly bundles **React** in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

  The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

  The app is ready to be deployed!

- Run the app in the optimized production mode

  ```console
  npx serve -s build
  ```

  Open `http://localhost:5000` to view it in the browser.

- Deploy the app in GitHub

  ```console
  yarn deploy
  ```

  After this you will see the page in `https://<username>.github.io/colour-clock-app/`
