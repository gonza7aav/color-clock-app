<!-- summary -->

A simple clock made to introduce myself into **React**, **PWA** and the deployment in **Github Pages**.

## üí° Motivation

Almost 3 years back, I have made this little clock in vanilla **JavaScript**. Once finished, I archived it in a folder... until now. I am starting in **React** and, why not recreating that colourful clock? At this moment, I wouldn't accept saving it again only on my pc, so I decided to host it with **Github Pages**.

Listening to some talks about **PWA**, I finally add the ability to install this web app on your device! After all, I just wanted to put this knowledge into practice.

## ‚ú® Demo

[Check it running!](https://gonza7aav.github.io/colour-clock/)

## üöß Prerequisites

- _[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)_

## üõ†Ô∏è Install

1. Download this repository

2. Install the dependencies

   ```console
   yarn install
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

In the project directory, you can:

- Run the app in the development mode

  ```console
  yarn start
  ```

  With each change, the page will reload, and in case of an error, you will see it in the terminal.

- Build the app for production

  ```console
  yarn build
  ```

  It correctly bundles **React** for production and optimizes the build for the best performance.

  The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

  The app is ready to be deployed!

- Run the optimized for production app

  ```console
  npx serve -s build
  ```

- Deploy the app in GitHub

  ```console
  yarn deploy
  ```

  After this you will see the page in `https://<username>.github.io/colour-clock/`.
